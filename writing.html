      <h2>28.09.25</h2>
      <p>I walk in my new city. Feeling its unfamiliar cracks under my ballet flats. To work I go, a new routine. Strangers make their way with me across the bridge. I think about stopping a beautiful one, eager to have my presence known in this new place. Eager to be the kind of person who stops a stranger at 8:37 in the morning. But I’m scared. I feel unfamiliar. Who am I here? Who am I without my normal running route, without the Sunday farmers market, without the inconvenient train to downtown Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>I used to know who I was. Reflections of other people. My sophomore year roommate’s habit of leaving kind notes, my mom’s anger, my high school peer’s love of early 2000s music, my best friend’s tendency towards aquatic motifs. I do that silly voice only because you do. I go to that kind of restaurant only because you do.</p>
      <p>But now I’m alone. Trying to figure out what’s left without the mirrors I kept in my pocket. They’re empty now. I reach my hands inside when I’m around these strangers. Searching for a shiny surface that brings out a part of me (of you) I love. I find something small and perform physical comedy for my coworkers. It feels good. But maybe that’s only because I want to tell you about it later. I compliment a necklace and hold the door for someone far behind me. I feel bright, as if I can be me without you. As if what made you, make me, was really me the whole time.</p> 
      <p>But I return home. To empty walls. Empty because the things that used to make my room mine were that they related to you.</p>
      <p>I try to figure out who I am alone. I buy a shirt I would feel embarrassed to wear in front of you. I go on a run without music to pretend to perform catharsis. I smile at one of these strangers. But I wonder what you would think of the shirt, imagine you jogging beside me, and want to notify you of my new-found bravery.</p>
      <p>I suppose for now, I must keep performing these acts. Even if they feel foreign. Strange in my body without you next to me. I have to hope my pockets will again have the familiar weight of familiar friendship. That all this new will start to look like myself.</p>

      <p>I want to be so open that there’s enough room for someone to fit inside perfectly. I want to move through the world as an empty box, waiting for you to crawl inside. I want to take everything you are and let it fill me up completely.</p>
      <p>But before you arrive, I’ll walk around empty. Unsure what’s there, without you, to fill me up. </p>
      <p>I want someone to wear my entire essence like a glove. I want to only be functional when you try me on. In the meantime, I’ll sit in the closet. Waiting an eternity for it to get cold enough for you to remember me.</p>
      <p>But, I am not a glove. I am a human girl. And so I need to go through my day, limp and lifeless. Finding small gusts of wind to hold me up. </p>

      <h2>26.10.25</h2>
      <p>I carry my laptop in a faux-snake-skin purse. A few months ago it lived in the backpack I purchased before my freshman year of college. I switched to the bag in an effort to achieve a more grown-up look after graduating. A hand-me-down from an old friend. I traded in my back pain for a sore shoulder. It made me feel cool. Like I knew where I was going. And that I was used to being asymmetrical.</p>
      <p>I hold this bag as I walk to work. It’s fabric wearing off like the falling leaves. I wonder if fellow-commuters can tell I’m new at purse-carrying. That my experience with a bag typically comes with a rounded spine. When I wear the purse on coffee dates and walks along the river, I want to tell my peer that this is new for me. That I’m making an effort to grow up. That, authentically, deep-down, at my core, I am a backpack-wearer. This is surely important for them to know. But I don’t mention it. And as we walk side by side, I move it over to my left shoulder so I don’t block our forming connection. I think I come across as someone who wears a bag. Perhaps my practice is paying off, or perhaps no one cares.</p>
      <p>There’s a chill outside. The first Thursday it feels like fall. I had been waiting for the east-coast air to have that familiar smell. One I haven’t encountered in five years. My body feels sad. Am I reminded of lonely days in high school? Of a temperate west-coast January? Of how much has changed so suddenly? </p>  
      <p>Fall came late this year. Leaves clung to trees until they rotted off in the extreme September heat. Never having the chance to develop reds and oranges. Wilting straight from green to brown. Summer did not want to leave. She hung around so long that it felt like it might be that way forever. It felt like I’ll always have my best friend, a long Friday lunch, and a party to look forward to. So when this Thursday came, I still wasn’t ready to change. It felt like forgetting you and remembering who I am. </p>  
      <p>I walk home from work. I wonder if fall will ever agree with me. If I’ll be missing forever. I adjust my bag higher up on my arm. I hear my name from across the street. The two syllables ringing over the sound of 5:16 traffic. A new friend has recognized me. As if I am a person to be recognized in this new place. A grown-up kind of person with an uneven walk and a faux-snake-skin purse. </p>

      <h2>18.11.25</h2>
      <p>I remember thinking I should write it down. It felt so poetic to be there. To notice. Our collective shape walking together. Me, teetering from side to side, pushing and pulling against the crook of your arm. I’m too excited to move steadily. I gesture with my other hand, it keeps my sentences fluid. I’m afraid if I stop talking it will become too intimate. That we’ll have to comment on our position. That someone else will notice. That you’ll pull away. That we’ll have to break our form. You slow down to keep in time with my awkward gait, a feature of mine I’m chronically insecure about. How my body, despite attempts at mobility and grace, refuses to move with the poise I think I should have. Ghosts of injuries dominate years of ballet training, making my walk something of a morbid creature. This doesn’t seem to bother you. At least not now. </p>
      <p>We move clumsily together. As a unit. We’re not used to standing together like this, meandering the tricky corners of a CVS in Midtown. A museum to us. We pick up items that have infinite ties to an impossibly long friendship. “Remember that?"</p>
      <p>And obviously I do. </p>
      <p>I remember it all.</p>
      <p>I’m on the plane traveling West. My first time crossing the Mississippi since I’ve been trying to forget. The last time was with you. A flight the same length, to a different end point, and I’d be in your city. You’d pick me up, I’d sit at your kitchen counter, you’d grab a grape from the fridge, I’d comment on the new couch. We’d go outside, walk, this time with a comfortable distance between us. I’d follow your path. If I wanted to, I’m sure I could remember the winding roads, but I’ve always had you to lead me. So I make turn after unexpected turn, eagerly waiting for you to paint a picture of a version of yourself who lived here. A version I know well from stories, from our first impressions, from spending so much time trying to figure you out.</p>
      <p>I’m on the plane reading a suggested book from a mutual friend. A book suggested to me in reference to you. It’s about grief. It’s about death. Death came near to me more times this year than ever before. It makes me want to live like tomorrow I would die. If tomorrow I would die, I would beg the pilot to go North instead of South. If tomorrow I would die, I would want to see the new couch. I tried to live this way with you. Leaving everything out on the table between us in a small cafe after an overnight bus trip. You don’t want this. I’m not sure what you want. I don’t think I feel much like listening. On our last phone call that felt honest, I said I just wanted to be close to you. You said you wanted to be close to me. </p>
      <p>I wanted us to be in our shape.</p>
      <p>The plane ride is turbulent. I think about what would happen if it crashed. How long would it take for the news to get to you? I’m not sure who would find out first. A handful of friends know where I’m going. No one has my flight number. Perhaps my coworkers would first notice. Somehow they would get a hold of my family. Would they think to contact you? It would take a while for you to find out. I texted you about the flight last night, at a time you should have responded. You didn’t. What would that last text be? Last words you’d hear from me. Notes on a new friend who shared a similar interest to us. The plan lands and I hope you’ve texted me. You haven’t.</p>
      <p>I go about my weekend, pretending not to notice we’re in the same time zone. But I can’t help it. It’s all I have to write down. </p>

      <h2>14.12.25</h2>
      <p>I have been scared of being my current age since I was young enough to notice time.</p>
      <p>I first noticed time when I was in grade school. Life was chunked into segments. Now I am in elementary school. I will soon be in middle school. Then I will be in high school. Time was stationed within specific buildings. The shapes of these buildings helped me understand age. The rooms that bounded second and third grade were smaller than fifth and sixth. </p>
      <p>In seventh grade I considered myself to be “halfway.” I inhabited a point equidistant to when I started noticing time, to when this kind of time would be finished. To when time would no longer be fixed to bounded vessels. To when time could no longer be described by its space. I’ll call this location time. I knew where the when would be. While it wasn’t so much of a tangible thought, I could picture these locations “running out.” In elementary school, I knew the high school I would attend. I knew what it looked like. After that, I had nothing to picture.</p>
      <p>I feared this new kind of time. I remember a friend’s older sister (older by just one year) turning thirteen. At a new thirteen, she told my mother, when asked about being a teenager (finally), that this age felt good. But noted how some don’t consider thirteen a true teenager. I felt relief upon learning this news. Relief because I had one extra year before this new segment of age. The teenage segment.</p>
      <p>I wonder why she mentioned this. Was she impatiently awaiting a learners permit and house parties? Things that didn’t come with being a mere thirteen. Did admitting her youth make her seem more mature in the presence of adults? A sort of rejection of her current adolescence. Was she also scared of becoming a teenager? Scared of location-less time. </p>
      <p>At my current age, I think to being thirteen. I think about how it’s the same distance between when I noticed time to when I considered location time to be over. I suppose that halfway point was the age of seventeen. Just before this location time ended. </p>
      <p>I recall an earlier memory. I recall realizing I had the ability to “remember.” I pumped some hand soap into my palm and internally declared that this would be an event I would commit to memory. With this memory of hand soap, I would store all the other things I wished to never forget. I do not recall these stored memories. Besides the first one I decided to attach to it. I had told myself to not forget that I wished to be a writer. I remember feeling that I would be disappointed if I never became one. This was something I found both important and evasive enough for me to store it in my separate memory box. I suppose I was afraid I would forget my childhood dream. And I suppose I have. Even if I remember the words.</p>
      <p>At seventeen, I knew how I wanted eighteen to look. I’d know where I would be going to college. I’d enter this college with a new found confidence. I’d be desired and wanted and at the start of the beginning of a long life of being these things. I never took a writing class. I instead studied science and had problems that existed right in front of me. </p>
      <p>At twenty-two, I feel the fear I felt when I had first noticed time. I feel aged. I’m not sure where I should be. I find myself in a city unfamiliar. I find myself sketching the outline of what my life should be. I find myself saying I’ve done something. I do not find myself all that expectant. I feel my hormones wish for children and love and feel passionless about my career. </p>
      <p>I’m still scared of this age. Fear had done nothing to prevent the inevitable clock to tick towards the early-twenties. I’m not sure when I’ll stop feeling scared. Time takes on new forms now. I wait for the work day to be over and beg the months to go by slower. I’m scared that it’s been six months since I graduated. Three since I’ve seen my best friend. Two since we stopped being that. </p>
      <p>I wish to be thirteen. Or maybe I wish to be someone else. I’m jealous of students walking in pairs to class. Of elderly people at the end of their life. Of seventeen year olds with one last chunk of location time. Of new parents. Of old friends. </p>
      <p>I still notice time. And I notice it continues to slip by. And I wonder how I’ll feel in eight more years. And if I’ll recognize this as another location that housed this stage of life. But, at twenty-two, when I reach out to touch the wall, I find nothing there. </p>
