      <p>
        I walk in my new city. Feeling its unfamiliar cracks under my ballet flats. To work I go, a new routine. Strangers make their way with me across the bridge. I think about stopping a beautiful one, eager to have my presence known in this new place. Eager to be the kind of person who stops a stranger at 8:37 in the morning. But I’m scared. I feel unfamiliar. Who am I in this new place? Who am I without my normal running route, without the Sunday farmers market, without the inconvenient train to downtown Los Angeles.
I used to know who I was. Reflections of other people. My sophomore year roommate’s habit of leaving kind notes, my mom’s anger, my high school peer’s love of early 2000s music, my best friend’s tendency towards aquatic motifs. I do that silly voice only because you do. I go to that kind of restaurant only because you do. 
But now I’m alone. Trying to figure out what’s left without the mirrors I kept in my pocket. They’re empty now. I reach my hands inside when I’m around these strangers. Searching for a shiny surface that brings out a part of me (of you) I love. I find something small and perform physical comedy for my coworkers. It feels good. But maybe that’s only because I want to tell you about it later. I compliment a necklace and hold the door for someone far behind me. I feel bright, as if I can be me without you. As if what made you, make me, was really me the whole time. 
But I return home. To empty walls. Empty because the things that used to make my room mine were that they related to you. 
I try to figure out who I am alone. I buy a shirt I would feel embarrassed to wear in front of you. I go on a run without music to pretend to perform catharsis. I smile at one of these strangers. But I wonder what you would think of the shirt, imagine you jogging beside me, and want to notify you of my new-found bravery. 
I suppose for now, I must keep performing these acts. Even if they feel foreign. Strange in my body without you next to me. I have to hope my pockets will again have the familiar weight of familiar friendship. That all this new will start to look like myself.
